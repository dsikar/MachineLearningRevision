\section{Probabilities}
The two fundamental rules of probabilities, sum rule:
\begin{equation}
    p(X) = \sum_Yp(X,Y)
\end{equation}
and the product rule:
\begin{equation}
    p(X,Y) = p(Y|X)p(X)
\end{equation}
Here, $p(X,Y)$ is a joint probability, that is "the probability of $X$ and $Y$". Similarly, the quantity $p(X|Y)$ is a conditional probability, that is "the probability of $X$ given $Y$", whereas the quantity $p(X)$ is a marginal probability, that is "the probability of $X$". Note $p(X,Y) = p(Y,X)$.
