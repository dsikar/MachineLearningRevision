Pick the value of p that makes the observation of 53 heads and 47 tails most probable.   
Since we want heads with a probability p to occur 53 times, and tails with a probability (1-p) to occur 47 times, we take our function $P(D)$  to be a product of all probabilities:
\begin{equation}
    P(D) = p^{53}(1-p)^{47}
\end{equation}
We are trying to minimize a function, so take the derivative with respect to p, applying the chain rule:
$$
\frac{dP(D)}{dp}=53p^{52}(1-p)^{47}(47p^{53}(1-p)^{46})(-1)
$$
then set the resulting expression equal to zero, and apply some algebraic manipulation:
\begin{align*}
0 & = 53p^{52}(1-p)^{47}(47p^{53}(1-p)^{46})(-1)  \\
& = 53p^{52}(1-p)^{47}(-47p^{53}(1-p)^{46}) \\
& = \frac{53p^{53}(1-p)^{47}}{p}\Bigg(\frac{-47p^{53}(1-p)^{47}}{(1-p)}\Bigg) \\
& = \Bigg(\frac{53}{p}-\frac{47}{1-p}\Bigg)(p^{53}(1-p)^{47})
\end{align*}
Since it would suffice that the expression
$$
\frac{53}{p}-\frac{47}{1-p}
$$
is equal to zero, we can solve for p:
\begin{align*}
\frac{53}{p}-\frac{47}{1-p} & = 0 \\
\frac{53}{p} & = \frac{47}{1-p} \\
53 - 53p & = 47p \\
p & = 0.53 \\
\end{align*}
